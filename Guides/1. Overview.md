# 1. Overview

First you need to decide which kind of `ProvidableKey` you want. A plain `String` might be working, but using the `GenericProvidableKey` with a typealias will be just fine.

```swift
enum ServicesKeyType { } // will never be instantiated
typealias Services = GenericProvidableKey<Services>

let serviceInjector = LazyInjector<Services>().globalize().erase()
serviceInjector // only Services will fit in here
```

You can use a globalized `LazyInjector` to provide your global services. This injector will be passed to every `ViewController`. Thereafter we erase the `Injector` in order to get rid of generics (`Injector where Key = MyKey` vs. `AnyInjector<MyKey>`).

```swift
// this will be passed to your RootViewController
let appInjector = LazyInjector<Services>().globalize().erase()
```

On segues, you can compose the `Injector` the `ViewController` received (for your RootViewController: `appInjector`).

```swift
protocol SessionService { }

extension Provider {
    static var sessionService: Provider<Services, SessionService> {
        return .derive()
    }
}

// then 
var segueInjector = StrictInjector<Services>()
segueInjector.inject(mySession, for: .sessionService)
let navInjector = segueInjector.compose(appInjector)
// All changes will now be performed on segueInjector by default, 
// but contents of appInjector are available, too
```
